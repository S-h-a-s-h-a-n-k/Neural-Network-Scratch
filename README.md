# Neural-Network-Scratch
Built my own neural network from scratch using Pandas and Numpy.
Key feature of this network is you can decide number of hidden layers and number of neurons in this hidden layers.
Also involves small batch while training for faster convergence.
Implemented this on mnist dataset(Hand written digits).
