# Neural-Network-Scratch
- Implementation of neural networks from scratch only using Numpy and Pandas.
- Users can decide the number of hidden layers.
- Users can give the size of each hidden layer as input.
- Uses small batches while training for faster convergence. 
- Users can also give pre-trained parameters for further training as input. 
- Implemented on Mnist dataset.
- Accuracy of 0.8558 achieved which can further be improved on further training.
